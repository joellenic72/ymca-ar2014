                        <h2>Causing Ripples in Water Safety</h2>
                        <p>The YMCA has been a wonderful resource for my family, and has always been a constant in our lives. We were members of the YMCA in Florida before being relocated to Virginia. When I was a child, I swam on the YMCA Bolts Swim Team. My niece currently competes with the YMCA gymnastics team, Team Florida. I was very happy to find and join a YMCA when I moved to Virginia. It reminded me of home and I knew I would not be disappointed. My 3 children have taken gymnastics, swimming, soccer, and basketball at the YMCA. The YMCA, once again, has become family. My daughter, Amalie, has taken private swim lessons at the YMCA for four years. She started at age 2, was swimming by age 3 and can now swim all four strokes and a 500 freestyle nonstop. Last summer, at a private pool party, my daughter was swimming in the deep end when she noticed an unconscious 4 year old on the bottom of the pool. She swam over and told me immediately. I pulled him out (not breathing, no pulse) and he was revived through CPR. The child is fine now and has no long term side effects. I put my daughter in swim lessons at the YMCA hoping that if she ever got into a dangerous water-related situation, the skills she learned would save her life. I never thought that the YMCA would help her to save another child’s life. I am so grateful that the YMCA taught my daughter to swim and I know that the little 4 year old boy and his family are as well. I know that my children are much safer in the water now, than they were before taking swim lessons at the YMCA.</p>
